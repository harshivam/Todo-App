Introduction

This is a Todo App project developed during my internship, aimed at helping users manage their tasks efficiently. The app incorporates user authentication using Firebase Authentication and stores tasks in a real-time database using Firebase Realtime Database. The user interface is designed to be sleek and intuitive, built entirely with Kotlin for the logic and XML views for the user interface.

Features
-

User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and log out securely using Firebase Authentication.

Task Management: Users can create, read, update, and delete tasks.

Real-time Data Updates: Changes to tasks are reflected in real-time across all instances of the app.

Sleek UI: The user interface is designed to be user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing, leveraging XML views for layout design.

Kotlin: The app logic is written entirely in Kotlin, taking advantage of its concise and expressive nature.

#Technologies Used
-

Firebase Authentication: Used for user authentication and security.
Firebase Realtime Database: Used to store tasks and enable real-time synchronization.
Kotlin: Primary language used for app development.
XML: Utilized for designing the user interface.
